Welcome to metahack.<br>
<br>
This project came to be in the late hours of MHacks IV as my Android Project had<br>
failed miserably and I was just about out of steam to try anything new.<br>
<br>
I believe there are a few potential flaws with hackathons, and metahack hopes to<br>
solve that. The first is a lack of ideas, and that's what the Inspiration button<br>
is for. It's not perfect, but it should be able to get the juices flowing.<br>
The second is far more complicated. Developers today are presented with a nearly<br>
limitless supply of APIs and Frameworks to use to develop their app, and it can be<br>
overwhelming. Currently metahack just recommends a random API to use. In the future<br>
this has the potential to be much more.<br>
<br>
I envision a future where hackers turn to metahack to put together an idea using<br>
the inspirationAlgorithm and are then given a selection of appropriate and effective<br>
APIs and Frameworks that should help them get their project done as efficiently as<br>
possible while opening a whole new world of possibilities.<br>
<br>
The current state of metahack is a mere shell of what it could become. There is no<br>
database magic, merely a few Javascript arrays. There is no magic inspriationAlgorithm,<br>
merely a random number generator. Someday that may change, and metahack could grow<br>
to be the one-stop-shop for all of your hackathon inspiration and planning.<br>
<br>
It's going to take some real planning and work, but the future is bright.
<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br><br>
